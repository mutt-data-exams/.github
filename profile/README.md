Mutt Data is a technology company that helps startups and big companies build and implement Machine Learning solutions that drive real business results. We guide companies into an AI-fueled future by building Modern Data Systems 🤖.

We are Amazon Advanced Consulting, Google Cloud Service, Astornomer, Kaszek, and Product Minds Partners.

Composed by computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians, economists, but above all *we are Data Nerds* 🤓.

### About our projects
We operate with technology startups and large companies in Argentina 🇦🇷, the United States 🇺🇸, Brazil 🇧🇷, Colombia 🇨🇴, Spain 🇪🇸, and Uruguay 🇺🇾. We have an extremely technical team and we have extensive experience in ML + Data Engineering projects.

We would like to keep growing in this direction with you. If you like to learn new tools, teach your colleagues, reduce technical debt, contribute to complex solutions, listen and to be listened to, take control of technical problems and work in a horizontal structure, this can be a good place for you 😊. 

These are some of the problems we solve:
* Use reinforcement learning to optimize the advertising investment.
* Build advertising auction systems in real-time.
* Predict electricity consumption demand on a large scale.
* Anomaly detection in activity levels of telecommunication services with millions of users. Implement stream processing systems to manage TBs of data.
* Build flexible and scalable cloud architectures that optimize costs and allow services to grow exponentially.
* Implement Deep Learning algorithms for video feeds data sources, to analyze and count people in customer care centers.

### Open Source Projects
* [Muttlib](https://github.com/MuttData/muttlib) - Library with helper code to start a data-related project.
* [SoaM](https://github.com/MuttData/soam) - SoaM is a Prefect based library created by Mutt. Its goal is to create a forecasting framework, this tool is developed with conjunctions of experience on previous projects.

### Data competitions
As you know, we are data nerds 🤓, so we are actively participating in data competitions 👨‍💻👩‍💻 such as:
* [Series de tiempo en Hopp | MetaData - Fundacion Sadosky](https://metadata.fundacionsadosky.org.ar/competition/26/)
* [Inteligencia Artificial para la Predicción de Incremental de Presiones por Interferencia | MetaData - Fundacion Sadosky](https://metadata.fundacionsadosky.org.ar/competition/29/)

### Our events 🍻

We have over 10 years of experience building data systems using Big Data, Public Cloud and Machine Learning. We believe in sharing the accumulated experiences and knowledge with the community 🤓.

We regularly participate and host meetups and workshops focusing on Data Engineering, Data Infrastructure, Data Science, Machine Learning and ML Ops.

We are organizers of the *Argentina Big Data Meetup* and *Machine Learning Seminar*, and we also teach in postgraduate programs from top universities in LATAM.
